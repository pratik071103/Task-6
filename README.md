# Task-6
This project showcases an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Online Orders dataset using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
The analysis involved writing SQL queries to uncover key business insights such as top-selling products, peak sales periods, 
customer behavior, and revenue trends. By using SQL techniques like grouping, aggregation, filtering
meaningful patterns were identified to support data-driven decisions. All insights were derived using
the syntax and instructions provided in the assigned tasks.
